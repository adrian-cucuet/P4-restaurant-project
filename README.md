### The Scope

#### Main Site Goals

![Colours Palete](./assets/readme/extras/tasty_blog_colors_palete.png)<br>

* The colour scheme is kept simple by opting for a combination of light and dark colors with a primary color as an accent.

#### Imagery

* All the imagery is related to the recipes and website design. Only 7 images are static.
The remaining imagery will be uploaded by the author to the database.
* For the purpose of the project all the images used are from template provided by [ThemeWagon](https://themewagon.com/)
